                        As of April 2025, SPLAT is one of the most played songs by the artist Connor Price. This is my take on a music video for the song!

                        This project was born from a class I took in the Fall of 2024. That class taught us how to utilize Adobe Premiere Pro along with a few other softwares, however, this project was made using only Adobe Premiere Pro.

                            SPLAT was the first project I had put serious time and effort into when it came to using Premiere Pro. I had messed around with its tools a couple times prior, but never took anything serious before SPLAT. It didn't take me long to really latch onto the project.

                            I love learning new skills and this project was a perfect catalyst to satiate that want!

                            The filming process took several days and because of the project due date, I ended up having to film in the rain for a few scenes. My camera man (Jude) and I got soaked on two occations during the process, but it was all worth it in the end!

                            At the time I had a story board for the intended outcome of the video. It was fun to see what started as sketches of stickfigures eventually become what it has. Sadly, the journal that once housed the story board has since been lost.

                            When I first decided to do SPLAT for the music video assignment, I wanted to do something fun with the lyric 'splat', as it falls on a beat drop. At one point I thought about utilizing the camera in a sort of second person point of view. Following my perspective, but from an outsiders view. This eventually resulted in me constructing the camera rig you see here.

                            The rig is made with a hinge at its base and a long arm to allow the phone to fall in an arc at the same time that I fall at various points in the video.
