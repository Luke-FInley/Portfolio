                        This project was my introduction to Houdini and Adobe After Effects. In the Fall of 2024 I took a class that taught us the basics of Adobe After Effects. At the time I was also interested in learning Houdini. I decided I wanted to make my first work in Houdini a part of one of my assignments for said class.

                        In the class that birthed this project, there were a number of recommended effects to utilize in After Effects to get full credit. One of those was a flying effect. I decided to do the flying effect with a little something extra. Another one of the recommended effects was a teleportation effect, which I also decided to implore at one point in the video as a sort of last minute idea.

                            The idea behind this project is pretty straight forward. I wanted to achieve a basic effect and go beyond the minimum of what would be expected. Flying off screen and landing in another location is relatively simple in After Effects, but I wanted to do more. That's when I realized I wanted to do the classic ‘Superhero Landing’.

                            I chose to work in Houdini on this project of my own fruition. I had the vision of this concept and wanted to do it justice, even if it meant having to learn a new program. This was, however, not good timing on my part as this was also my very first experience with Adobe After Effects.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                        
                            I watched dozens of Houdini tutorials and followed along with several over the period of a couple days before feeling comfortable enough to attempt the project. My first attempt ended up not working because I didn’t realize I needed a front plate and a back plate. My second attempt is what you see in the final product. I realized retroactively, though, that I forgot to weight paint the front plate.

                            Working in Adobe After Effects for the first time was a very interesting process. The way the timeline functions was the first thing that threw me for a loop. Thankfully, my teacher was able to explain the tools and functionality of the program well. The fact that my roommate was the TA also didn’t hurt.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            It was a steep learning curve, but once I got the hang of things, I loved working in sub-compositions, and experimenting with as many effects as I could find. Eventually, I was able to apply some of those effects and lessons to the Houdini render, and rest of the project.
