                        I am a massive fan of Dungeons and Dragons. So much so that I have developed a diorama making hobby to further my love for the game. This build is the second diorama I have ever made.

                        This project utilizes a substantial amount of XPS Foam, Plaster, Paint, Resin, Balsa Wood, Sawdust, and other similar materials. This piece was constructed to be a centerpiece and functional combat arena for the final session of a semester-long Dungeons and Dragons campaign I ran my Sophomore year at Miami University.

                            For those unaware: Dungeons and Dragons is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) that functions around the premise of one player being the ‘narrator’ and the others being the ‘characters’ as if in a book. 

                            <br>
                            <br>
                        
                            These games can last days, months, or even years depending on the group. I played the narrator in a game that lasted the second semester of my sophomore year at Miami University. In the climax of the story, the main characters had a final showdown with the villain of the story. The location of that final showdown is what you see here.

                            The Making Of

                        </div>

                        <div class="process-body">

                            The creation process for this piece began with trying to find a way to make a body of the island shapes. I used two different processes for each of the islands as I was experimenting with how each process would work. 

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            The grey island utilizes a basis of cardboard boxes, tape, strips of cardboard, a mixture of flower and PVA glue, and a spare bed sheet, all sealed together with more PVA glue. The base of the more lush island was made using several layers of XPS Foam glued together with hot glue that was then cut into a more unique shape using a handheld hot-wire cutter. 
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            I could go on and on about each intricate step, but here's the short version: 
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            I used plaster and foil to make rock formations that I glued to the islands. I carved bricks into the bridge using an exacto knife and widened the gaps using a pencil. I used an old grill chain as the chains on the skeleton. I cut and glued balsa wood to make a dock and ladder to the top of the first island. I modeled both of the characters in Heroforge, and printed them with a resin printer. I made the grass utilizing paint, a sieve, and sawdust. Finally, after everything was sealed using a primer of some kind, I painted the whole thing using various techniques.
