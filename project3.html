                        This project is thanks to an assignment in a class I took in the Fall of 2024. In this class we learned about Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Cinema4D. This project was supposed to demonstrate our understanding of all three of these programs, thus there was no prompt given. Instead We were given free reign as long as it utilized all three programs.

                        I was initially super ambitious with this project: wanting to do three to five robots instead of one. I wanted there to be several instances of the robots dying and whatnot as well, but this was all without taking into account the time constraint.

                            The Concept

                        <div class="process-body">

                            The concept for this project was first inspired by the infamous home invasion scene in the first John Wick movie. I wanted to have several robots come in and each get picked off one by one. Once I remembered I only had a week and change to do this project though, I reeled it in to be a little more attainable. 

                            <br>
                            <br>
                        
                            After I had the concept, I had to storyboard the sequence. Said storyboard has since been lost, however, I do remember the one shot that birthed the whole thing:
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            I don’t remember why, or when, but I was ideating on the project when the shot of the robot strafing through the living room shooting just hit me. I had the idea to have the muzzle flash light up the room and send a shadow onto the back wall. The rest of the video was shaped around getting that shot.

                            I began with recording all of the shots needed (as per the storyboard) utilizing a tripod. I then took a model from Sketchfab of a star wars droid, utilized Mixamo animations (along with some hand-made adjustments), and parented a gun model to the droid's hand. 
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        
                            I reconstructed each of the shots with shadow catchers and some colored surfaces to imitate the reflections on the droid’s metal body. I rendered all of these bits and put them into Adobe After Effects where I recreated the grain of the video camera, adjusted some of the shadows, lighting, etc. I compiled everything into Adobe Premiere Pro, where I voiced over some of the sections with bad audio quality, added in gun sound effects, and bullet holes.

                            My biggest mistake with this project was easily my time management and sense of scope. I gave myself a goal that would have initially required upwards of eight unique shots over the period of a 12, or so, days all while having several other classes that needed work done.

                            I remember staying up until 6AM working on this project the day it was due. When I looked at the clock I realized that there was no way I was going to finish the whole chase scene I had planned with render times alone. I quickly threw in the black screen with text on them asking the audience to clap as an attempt to make humor of my shortcomings. When we presented our projects at 11AM that day, most people did indeed find humor in the incomplete product.
