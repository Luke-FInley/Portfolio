                    I am an avid enjoyer of table top games (as you will see throughout my portfolio), as well as a regular hiker, and book reader!

                <div>
                    My TTRPG (Table Top Role Playing Game) of choice is Dungeons and Dragons. I've been a regular player of the game for just over six years now. It is one of my biggest sources of creative inspiration both in, and out, of game.
                </div>
                            <br>
                <div>
                    When it comes to hiking, my favorite types of trails are without a clear path. While there might be some risk of getting lost, I just love seeing where the natural flow of nature will take me!
                </div>
                           <br>
                <div>
                    And when it comes to books, my indulgence are primarily within the high fantasy setting, or dystopian societies. Two of my favorites are the Scythe series by Neal Shusterman, and American Gods by Neil Gaiman.
