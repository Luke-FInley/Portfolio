                        Atom is a character from the 2011 movie Real Steel starring Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo. As a kid I was obsessed with the movie. Watching Real Steel is the first time I can recall recognizing CGI as a cool and creative element of media. It inspired me, even back then!

                        <br>

                        Fast forward to Fall 2024: I had a class that was teaching us the basics of 3D modeling softwares such as Blender and Cinema4D. And for one of my projects, I chose to revisit that old inspiration.

                            In the movie, Real Steel, Atom is a boxing robot found in a scrap yard. This 'short film' project is my take on what happened to Atom before he ended up in that scrap yard.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            I also revisited this movie because I had just rewatched it a month or so prior to the project being assigned. The movie mentions that Atom's model was sold by a company by Hammerhead Industries, hence the ending of the film with Atom being bought up by said company.

                            Storyboarding

                        </div>

                        <div class="process-body">

                            The initial storyboard for the film was made to be a silent film. The concept being that Atom's creator (me) would make videos testing Atom's capabilities with a test number in the corner of each shot.
                    
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            The initial intent was to have Atom continue to break and glitch until eventually he works and I celebrate. 
                            This pivoted to the final idea when I realized I didn't have enough time to make two minutes of animations and their render times. I also got the idea of Hammerhead Industries buying up Atom at this time. So I decided to pivot to a spoken dev-log instead with some select recordings.

                        </div>

                        <div class="process-body">

                            My initial thought for creating these scenes with Atom was to use a program called Rokoko Studio. Rokoko offers AI motion and body tracking data without the need of a suit, however, the results from my tests were not great. So, I moved on to Mixamo and hand animating.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            The reason Rokoko didn't work out was because I only had a single camera, while Rokoko recommends at least two at different angles.

                            Compositing

                        </div>

                        <div class="process-body">

                            I recorded everything at night because I found compositing in the dark with few light sources to be far easier to make convincing results. After rendering out all of my animations, I initially took them into After Effects to fix some of the lighting and reflections on Atom, before exporting those into Premiere Pro. 
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            Premiere is where I did my Dev Log recordings with several outfit changes and changes in my tone of voice in an attempt to make it feel like the logs were taken far apart. I finalized the product with an adjustment layer with a sepia filter.
